                         Hi there and welcome to cryptobase! Cryptobase is web application that allows users to monitor their favorite cryptocurrencies. Users will recieve updates via SMS when their selected cryptocurrencies fall or rise to their designated prices. For to long various crypto and stock monitoring platforms have required users to divulge excessive amounts of user data. This will no longer be the case. Cryptobase merely require users to enter the coin they would like to track, the low & high price they wished to be notified at, and their phone number for SMS notification. Cryptobase guarantees that users' phone numbers will not be sold to advertisers, nor will they be messaged by Cryptobase for any other matter than the coin that they are monitoring!
